Project feedback and mark details

Correctness and adherence to specification:  30  (out of 30%)

- At the very last line of three_musketeers.py, consider modifying your code as follows to ensure your code runs as submitted (whilst also running without modification in pytest). 

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        start()

- Your functionality works as specified. Well Done!


Completeness of code, tests, and commit history:  30    (out of 30%)   

- Your implementation is complete.
- Your 20 tests all pass. Your number of tests is appropriate for the project.
- GitHub session 7 initial commit is present.
- Your GitHub commit history is good.


Coding style: 9   (out of 10%) 

- Your coding style is overall good. 
- Consider writing more succinct code where possible. e.g. in three_musketeers.py (line 243) change:

    if (row >= 0 and row <= 4) and (col >= 0 and col <= 4):
        return True
    else: 
        return False 

to:

    return (row >= 0 and row <= 4) and (col >= 0 and col <= 4)



Extension:  8     (out of 30%) 

-
- You have implemented the file saving extension which attempts to save the state of the board.
- Your code does not run as submitted, giving exceptions as follows:

Do you want to save the current board (Y) or not (N) ?Y
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/richard/PycharmProjects/POP1marking/venv/three_musketeers.py", line 433, in <module>
    start()
  File "/home/richard/PycharmProjects/POP1marking/venv/three_musketeers.py", line 417, in start
    board = move_musketeer(users_side)
  File "/home/richard/PycharmProjects/POP1marking/venv/three_musketeers.py", line 374, in move_musketeer
    three_musketeers_with_files.save_board()
  File "/home/richard/PycharmProjects/POP1marking/venv/three_musketeers_with_files.py", line 14, in save_board
    pickle.dump(three_musketeers.get_board(), outfile)
  File "/home/richard/PycharmProjects/POP1marking/venv/three_musketeers.py", line 74, in get_board
    return board
NameError: name 'board' is not defined


- Consider if your code should save whether you are the musketeer or the enemy.
- Consider adding functionality to allow multiple games to be saved (perhaps by specifying the filename).
- Your code asks the user if they want to save the game after every move - consider making this more user friendly (e.g. giving the user the option of entering 'S' to save a game instead of entering a move).
